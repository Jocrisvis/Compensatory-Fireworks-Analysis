# Compensatory-Fireworks-Analysis

## Worker Benefits Unfairness Project

This project explores how benefits are distributed among workers and how unfairness is distributed.

### Overview
- Each time a worker's **ID** is added, the system assigns them a **random number of benefits**.  
- These accumulated benefits are **unique to each worker** and stored in a dedicated dataset.  
- The dataset is then analyzed to measure **fairness** in the distribution process.  

### Goal
To add fireworks everytime you add a new ID, fireworks makes people feels better
